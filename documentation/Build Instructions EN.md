## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 0: Preparing the PCB  

Familiarize yourself with the PCB.  

Place the components according to the white markings on the PCB. üõ†Ô∏è Solder each component on the opposite side of the PCB.  

We will guide you through each component step by step.  

Refer to [Step 5: Finished PCB](#step-5-finished-pcb) for an image of the completed board.

### Step 1: Soldering the Button  

Insert the button into the designated spot (SW1). The marking is on the back of the PCB.  

> **Note:**  
> You can place the button on the front side of the PCB if you prefer. The USB cable may get in the way if the button is placed on the back. Choose the placement that works best for you. üòä  

Solder the button in place. üî•  

If this is your first time soldering and you need help, check the [How to Solder Guide](/documentation/How%20to%20Solder.md) or ask us.

### Step 2: Placing the LEDs

Cut the legs of all 11 LEDs just after the thick section, as shown in the image.

> **Tip:**  
> Hold the LED legs firmly while cutting them to prevent them from flying across the room and causing injury. ‚ö†Ô∏è

  <img src="/documentation/images/LED_Beine_Schneiden.png" alt="Cutting LED Legs" width="200"/>
</div>

Insert the first LED into its designated spot, ensuring that the flat side of the LED matches the flat side of the marking on the PCB.

> **Caution:**  
> ‚ùó Ensure the correct orientation of the LED ‚ùó

  <img src="/documentation/images/LED_falsch_Platziert.png" alt="LED Incorrectly Placed" width="200"/>
</div>

Bend the four legs of the LED toward the adjacent solder pads (as shown in the images) to secure it. You can use a small flathead screwdriver to assist with bending.

> **Caution:**  
> ‚ùó Double-check the LED's orientation before soldering. The flat sides must align! ‚ùó

Solder the bent legs of the LED to the pads (do not solder at the holes where the legs are inserted). 

Repeat these steps for all remaining LEDs. üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 3: Soldering the 2x8 Pin Headers

Solder both **2x8 Pin Headers** onto the PCB as shown in the images.

### Step 4: Inserting the ESP32

Insert the ESP32 with its pin headers into the inner rows of the 2x8 pin headers. The USB-C port should point toward the tree's tip. üîù

</div>

> **Important:**  
> Ensure that the **long pins** of the headers point down into the pin sockets and the **short pins** are on the ESP board.

Now, solder all 16 pins of the ESP board to the pin headers. üî•  

Be careful not to damage components on the ESP board. Solder from the outside, not over the board.

</div>

> **Note:**  
> After soldering, the ESP board can be easily removed if needed for another project.

### Step 5: Finished PCB

Once all components are soldered, your PCB should look like this:

![Image: Finished PCB Back](/documentation/images/Platine_fertig_hinten.jpg)

> **Important:**  
> Ensure the USB-C port points upward toward the tree's tip. If not, remove and reposition the ESP.

### Step 6: Flashing the Software

Go to the **"Flash Station"** to upload the WLED software to the microcontroller. Without the software, the LEDs will only glow blue... very blue. üîµ

---

### Step 7: Powering Up & Quick Guide

Connect the USB-C cable to the ESP and plug it into a USB power supply or USB power bank (5V, min. 1A). The tree should briefly light up blue and then orange.

You can change the sequence and colors of the blinking lights by clicking the button. Press and hold the button to turn the lights on and off. üí°

Additionally, your Christmas tree has a Wi-Fi access point that you can connect to. The login credentials were provided during flashing.

- Connect your smartphone to the tree's Wi-Fi (e.g., `WLED-AP-c352c7`).
- Your smartphone may prompt you with a notification to access the light settings.
- If not, visit `4.3.2.1` in your web browser.

Use your smartphone to control the lights and change settings. üì±‚ú®

## Congratulations! üéâ

You've successfully completed the project!

If you want to do more with your tree and WLED, here are some inspirations:

- Synchronize multiple trees over Wi-Fi (WLED UDP Sync) [DE](https://wled-faq.github.io/#tab5faq4) / [EN](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/udp-notifier/)
- Set a different default blinking pattern or colors when powering on the tree (create a preset with an ID and set it in `LED Preferences` under `Apply Preset on Boot`)
- Make LEDs blink to music ("audioreactive" requires an additional microphone that can be connected to spare pin headers) [DE](https://wled-faq.github.io/#tab5faq4) / [EN](https://kno.wled.ge/advanced/audio-reactive/)
- Integrate with a smart home system (Home Assistant) [EN](https://kno.wled.ge/advanced/home-automation/)
- ... (Google for more)
