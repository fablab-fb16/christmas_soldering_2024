# Christmas Soldering Workshop 2024 - Build Instructions

Welcome to our Christmas Soldering Workshop 2024! 🎄 In this guide, we will solder a PCB with an ESP32, LEDs, and a button together. It’s a great opportunity to learn more about electronics and soldering while creating a festive project that also functions as a Christmas tree. ✨

## Required Components

Make sure you have all the following components ready before you start soldering. 😊 Take the parts from the boxes and count them to ensure you don't forget anything!

- 1 x PCB (Christmas Tree Design)
- 11 x LEDs
- 1 x ESP32 (with pin headers)
- 1 x Button
- Various soldering materials (soldering iron, solder, wire cutters)
- USB-C cable

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Step: Preparing the PCB

Start by preparing the PCB. Make sure to place the components according to the markings on the PCB. 🛠️

### 2. Step: Soldering the Button

Place the button in the designated spot and solder it in place. 🔥 You can also place the button on the front side of the PCB if you prefer. In this case, it's the better option since the USB cable won't be in front of the button. But it's up to you where to place it. 😊

### 3. Step: Placing the LEDs

Cut the legs of the LEDs right after the thick section, as shown in the picture. **Important:** Hold the LED legs firmly while cutting them to prevent them from flying around and injuring you or others. ⚠️

</div>

❗❗❗ **Place the LEDs in the designated spots and make sure the flat side of each LED is placed on the flat side of the PCB.** ❗❗❗

</div>

Then bend the LED legs so they sit securely on the PCB, and only then solder them in place. 🛠️

### 4. Step: Soldering the Pin Headers on the ESP32

Then solder the **2x8 Pin Headers** first to the PCB, as shown in the image.

### 5. Step: Inserting the ESP32 into the Pin Headers

Now, insert the pins of the ESP32 into the 2x8 Pin Headers and solder them in place. 🖤

Make sure the **shorter legs** of the pin headers are on the ESP32 and the **longer legs** point downward. 🔩

### 6. Step: Finished Assembled PCB

After you have successfully soldered all the components, your PCB should look like this:

## Congratulations! 🎉

Now you have successfully completed the small project! You can change the order in which the lights blink by clicking the button once. If you press and hold the button, you can turn the lights on and off. 💡

Additionally, your Christmas tree now has an access point, which you can connect to. You can control the lights and change settings using your phone. 📱✨
